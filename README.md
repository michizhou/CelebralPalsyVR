# CelebralPalsyVR

Our project is a series of VR-based games that help rehabilitate cerebral palsy patients who are partially able to move their feet and/or hands. The patient uses an Oculus Rift headset with arduino sensors attached to their legs and hands. The game begins with the cerebral palsy patients navigating through a maze. They move by walking in place in their desired direction. The second and third aspect of the game is recording and detailing hand and feet movements.
